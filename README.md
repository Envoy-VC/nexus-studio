# 🧩 Nexus Studio  
**Visualize. Simulate. Execute. — Cross-chain interoperability on Avail, made simple.**

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Nexus Studio** is a **drag-and-drop playground** that lets you **visualize, simulate, and execute cross-chain transactions** across the **Avail Nexus** network.

It transforms the Avail interoperability layer into a **visual flow builder**, where each node represents a step in your cross-chain logic — from asset transfers to smart contract calls.  
With a few clicks, you can model complex rollup interactions, preview how data and assets move, and execute them live — all without writing a single script.

## 🪐 What Is Avail Nexus?

**Avail Nexus** is part of the [Avail Stack](https://availproject.org/), which delivers:
- **Modular data availability (DA)**
- **Seamless interoperability (Nexus)**
- **ZK-verified execution**

Nexus connects rollups and appchains within the Avail ecosystem, allowing them to share liquidity and infrastructure.  
For example, a user on *Sophon* can interact with *Uniswap on Lens* **without leaving Sophon** — no bridging, no switching wallets.  
All cross-chain communication happens automatically behind the scenes.

**Nexus Studio** makes this process **visible, programmable, and testable**.

## 🧠 How It Works

The visual flow builder revolves around four core **node types**:

| Node Type | Icon | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| **Terminal Node** (Source / Destination) | 🟢🔴 | Defines the start and end points of a transaction flow. |
| **Transfer Node** | 💸 | Moves assets across chains using Nexus messaging. |
| **Bridge Node** | 🌉 | Handles cross-rollup bridging with DA and proof verification. |
| **Execute Node** | ⚙️ | Performs smart contract calls on destination rollups. |

Each node is configurable via a side panel where you can set parameters such as:
- Chain name  
- Token / amount  
- Contract address & function  
- Dependencies on previous nodes  

You can then **simulate** the flow to preview how assets and messages move across rollups.  
Once ready, you can **execute** the same flow live using a connected wallet.
